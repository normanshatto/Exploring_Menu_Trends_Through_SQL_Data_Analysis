# Exploring_Menu_Trends_Through_SQL_Data_Analysis

Author: Norman Shatto
Databases: MySQL

Summary:
In this project, I took on the role of a data analyst working with a restaurant to uncover actionable insights from its sales data. Using a MySQL database, I analyzed order patterns, transaction records, and customer behavior through a series of SQL queries. The analysis revealed key trends such as peak ordering times, the most popular menu items, and shifts in customer preferences. This provided the restaurant with valuable information to optimize operations and enhance customer satisfaction.
